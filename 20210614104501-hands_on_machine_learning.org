*** What is Machine Learning?
    Science and art of programming computers so that they can learn from data

    Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
      -- [[file:20210615190411-arthur_samuel.org][Arthur Samuel]], 1959

    A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to
    some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T,
    as measured by P, improves with experience E.
      â€” [[file:20210615190527-tom_mitchell.org][Tom Mitchell]], 1997
**** spam filter example
     Spam filter uses examples of spam emails (flagged by users) plus examples of regular emails to learn to flag spam
     The examples the system uses to learn are called the [[file:20210615190626-training_set.org][training set]]
     Each singular example is called a [[file:20210615190822-training_instance.org][training instance]] or [[file:20210615190826-training_sample.org][training sample]]

     Using above quote,
       Task T: flag spam for new emails
       experience E: is the training data
       performance measure P: needs to be defined
         could use ratio of correctly classified emails
           this is also known as accuracy
             often used in classification tasks
**** Training set
     examples that a machine learning system uses to learn
***** Training sample or training instance
      a singular of a training example

**** Because it can automate program improvement
***** How would you make a spam filter with traditional programming?
      1. Consider what spam normally looks like. Look for words, phrases like "4u" or "free"
      2. write a detection algorithm for each pattern, flagging emails as spam if some number of patterns were detected
      3. test and repeat steps 1 and 2 until good enough to launch

      Will likely become a long list of hard to maintain rules
****** Machine learning example better:
       automatically learns which words and phrases are good predictors of spam by detecting unusually frequent patterns of words in the spam examples compared to the ham examples
       Shorter program
       easier to maintain
       probably more accurate
****** for example, if the data changes:
       If spammers noticed "4u" is blocked and change to "for u"
       The traditional spam filter would need to be updated
       You'll have to keep writing new rules forever
******* but if spam filter is written with Machine Learning techniques
        it will notice that "For U" has become unusually frequent in spam flagged by users
        will start flagging them without programmer intervention
**** For problems that are too complex or have no known algorithm
***** speech recognition
      try writing a program capable of distinguishing "one" and "two"
      you could think ok "two" starts with a high-pitch sound, and hardcode
      an algorithm that measures high-pitched sound and uses that to distinguish ones and twos
      but the technique won't scale to thousands of words spoken by millions of different people in noisy environments
****** machine learning solution
       an algorithm that learns by itself given many example recording for each word
**** to help humans learn
     You can inspect ML algorithms to see what they've learned
***** Spam filter can be inspected to see the list of words that it believes predicate spam
      this can reveal unsuspected correlations or new trends
      which leads to better understanding of the problem
***** data mining
      digging into large amounts of data to help discover patterns that were not immediately apparent
**** summation; machine learning is good for:
***** problems for which solutions require lots of fine-tuning or long lists of rules
      machine learning algorithm can simplify code and perform better
***** complex problems for which a traditional approach yields no good solution
      best machine learning techniques can find a solution
***** fluctuating environments
      machine learning system can adapt to new data
***** getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data
*** Machine learning application examples
