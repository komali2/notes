* Preface
  Assumption: I know nothing about Machine Learning
  Book will give me concepts, tools, and intuition necessary to implement programs capable of learning from data.
** frameworks used
*** Scikit-learn
    easy to use
    implements many Machine Learning algorithms efficiently
    good entry point
*** TensorFlow
    Complex library
    Distributed numerical computation
    Train and run very large neural networks efficiently
      Does so by distributing the computations across 100s of multi-GPU servers
    Created at google
    open sourced in november 2015
*** Keras
    High level deep learning API
    Can run on top of
      TensorFlow
      Theano
      Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)
**** tensorflow comes with implementation of kears api
     tf.keras
     provides support for advanced tensorflow features - efficiently load data
** Code examples available as jupyter notebooks
   https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2.
** Prerequisites
*** numPy, pandas, matplotlib
*** calculus
*** linear algebra
*** probabilities
*** statistics
