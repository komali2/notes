#+TITLE: Cory Doctorow MAsque Talk

* Trash Future
** line go up running gag podcast
*** kind of like an AI that is taught only to make the score go up in a game
*** if you focus on making the line go up , it probably will
*** but it won't necessarily improve the wya you want
*** but the line doesn't affect whether government workers get paid
**** so the line is the domain of a small number of specialists
**** finance used to be a dull, unimaginative, cushy job, decent pension etc
***** no long hours or whatever
***** no room for ambition
***** it might go back to this
**** if governments just spend money into exist finance will stop being sexy
**** or we could go back to hoover years, 10 year gilded age
**** austerity to make line go up again
**** but it'll break again
**** it'll end up like italy - only way to compete is to cheat
**** you'll lose your ability to be resilient to social defection
** eindhove's law
*** anything you measure will increase
* on the media segment on preppers
* tripartate civ
** some were born to rule, some to pray, some to work
* cory robin - the reactionary moind
** history of right wing thought
* poe's law
* was it hard to write a terrible person?
** just saying back to the finance people what they have been saying infurates them
*** saying the quiet part out loud
* book: winner take all
* scientific method:
** make really smart people explain why they think what they thikn
** expose them to not so smart people's reasoning
** because even the smartest of the smart can get wrapped up in themselves
*** and make stupid mistakes
** so this is why we can't count on billionaires to figure out how to best redistribute wealth
*** making a micromessaging platform doesn't mean you know how to do that
*** there's no accountability
*** they're not domain experts
*** you wouldn't have them fly a crashing plane
*** so they shouldn't decide a pandemic response
