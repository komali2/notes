* Divisibility tests
** 2
*** is the one's place divisible by 2?
** 3
*** Add all digits. Is the Sum divisible by 3?
**** recursively add if necessary
*** Why?
**** You can break down
     498
    4 ( 1 + 99) + 9(1 + 9) + 9
    [[file:20200324181441-distributive_property.org][distributive property]]: 4 * 1 + 4 * 99 = 4 (1 + 99)
  4 + (4 * 99) + 9 + (9*9) + 8
  Since 99 and 9 are both divisible by 3, the product of anything
  times (something divisible by 3) will be divisible by 3
** 4
*** Are the last 2 digits divisible by 4?
** 5
*** Is the final digit a 5 or a 0?
** 6
*** Is it divisible by 2 AND 3?
** 9
*** Sum all digits. Is the sum divisible by 9?
*** Why?
**** same reasons at 3
** 10
*** 0 in the one's place

* Recognizing divisibility
* [[file:20200324183005-factors.org][Factor]]
** Number A is a FACTOR of Number B if Number B can be divided by A without a remainder
** 2 is a factor of 10
** A [[file:20200324184154-whole_number.org][whole number]] that can [[file:20200324184158-divide.org][divide]] evenly into another number.
* [[file:20200324184021-multiples_algebra.org][Multiple]]
** Number A is a MULTIPLE of Number B if Number B can be multiplied by Number N to make Number A
** Number N is another MULTIPLE of number B
** 10 is a multiple of 2 (and 5)
* Finding [[file:20200324183005-factors.org][factors]] of a number
** Starting from one, test [[file:20200324183121-divisibility.org][divisibility]] while increasing
** record the low and high number if [[file:20200324183121-divisibility.org][divisibility]] test passes
** you're basically "working your way in"
  120
1 * 120, 2 * 60 etc, so you go 1..... 120, 1 2 .... 60 120
** If asked whether something is a factor of another number, first just test the [[file:20200324183121-divisibility.org][divisibility]] of the "another number"
  Which of the following Numbers ia  factor of 154: 3, 5, 6, 9, 14
  First just check if 154 is [[file:20200324183740-divisible.org][divisible]] by 3, 5, 6 etc using the [[file:20200324183121-divisibility.org][divisibility]] tests
* Finding [[file:20200324184021-multiples_algebra.org][multiples]] of a [[file:20200324184026-number.org][number]]
** Just add the number up again and again and see if other numbers are there
  which of the following numbers is a factor of 14? just add 14
14 , 28, 42, 56, 70 etc
* [[file:20200329143459-prime_numbers.org][prime numbers]]
** simple, but the basis for tons of crazy stuff, like [[file:20200329143505-cryptography.org][cryptography]]
** important!!
** a number is [[file:20200329143459-prime_numbers.org][prime]] if:
*** it's a [[file:20200329143515-natural_number.org][natural number]] (1, 2, 3) ([[file:20200329143529-positive_integers.org][positive integers]])
*** divisible by exactly 2 natural numbers
**** itself
**** one
** prime numbers:
*** 1
**** not prime
**** because it's not divisible by EXACTLY 2 natural numbers
**** even those it's divisible by one and itself
*** 2
**** prime
**** divisible by one
**** divisible by 2
**** only even prime number
*** 3
**** prime
**** divisible by one and three
*** 4
**** not prime
**** divisible by 1, 2, 4
* composite number
** a non-prime number
* determine if something is prime or composite
** think of all the natural numbers you can divide into the number in question with no remainder
* prime factorization
** list out prime numbers, and going pu see which ones go into the number in question
     75
    /  \
   3   25
      /  \
     5   5
  this is done now, because the bottom numbers are all prime
75 = 3 * 5 * 5
** listing out all the smallest prime numbers that multiply to make up a number
* exponential notation
** collapse multiplications into exponents
3 * 5 * 5 = 3 * 5^2
* common divisibility examples
** all numbers divisible by two numbers (x and y) are also divisible by all the prime factors of those numbers
           12 and 20
          /  \
         2   6
            /  \
            2   3
* Associative property of multiplication
** numbers can be multiplied in any order, they will result in the same number
5 * (2 * 9) = (5 * 2) * 9 = 90
* inverse property of addition
** if you add the negative of a number to that number, you results with 0
** or if you add the positive of a number to a negative number, you result with 0
* least common multiple
** the lowest number that is a multiple of both number A and number B
*** 36 is the least common multiple of 18 and 12
** find by
*** finding the prime factorization of both numbers
*** then reducing down as follows:
    18          12
   /  \         / \
   2  9       2     6
     / \           /  \
    3   3        2    3

18 = 2 * 3 * 3
12 = 2 * 2 * 3

lcm(18, 12) = 2 * 3 * 3
              2 * 2 * 3
              x       x
              only one gets through
           =  2 * 2 * 3 * 3
*** the least common multiple's prime factorization is a superset of both of the prime factorizations
**** has all of their prime factors in it as many times as we have in any ONE of these
*** or, brute force
**** find the multiples of both
18, 36, 54
12, 24, 36
* Greatest Common Factor
** Also known asGreatest Common Divisor
** Two methods to solve
** What is the greatest common divisor of 20 and 40?
*** what is the largest number that is divisible INTO both 20 and 40?
**** 20 is divisible into 40
**** 40 can be divided in 20
**** 20 is the largest number divisible into 40 AND 20
** What is the greatest common divisor of 10 and 7
*** one way is to list all the factors of each of those number
**** then figure out which is the biggest factor of both
**** 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
***** work left/right (1 * 10, 2 * 5)
**** 7: 1, 7
**** Only one common factor here: 1
**** Thus, the greatest common factor, or greatest common divisor, is 1
** gcd(21, 30)
*** List method
**** 21: 1, 3, 7, 21
**** 30: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10 15, 30
**** Common factors: 1, 3
**** Greatest common factor is 3
*** Prime factorization technique:
           21            30
          /  \          /  \
         3   7         3    10
                           /  \
                          2    5
*** Can be faster
** gcd(105, 30)
*** prime factorization
**** Find the common prime factors
       105
      /   \
     5     21
          /  \
         3    7
   105 = 3 * 5 * 7
   30  = 2 * 3 * 5
   3 and 5 are the common factors
   so the GCP is 3 * 5 = 15
