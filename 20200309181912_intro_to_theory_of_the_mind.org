** logical and conceptual relations between [[file:20200309182233_mental_states.org][mental states]] aren't the whole story, you need to avoid [[file:20200309182223_circularity.org][circularity]] or [[file:20200309182226_infinite_regress.org][infinite regress]]
** a network of [[file:20200309182315_intent.org][intentional mental states]] rest on a [[file:20200309182517_background_of_capacities.org][background]] of non-intentional capacities of interaction
*** example: intentional mental state: desire to have a beer, and belief that there is beer in the fridge
**** meaning is derived from the relation to eachother
*** but these only function against a [[file:20200309182517_background_of_capacities.org][background of capacities]]
*** the ability to move around and manipulate the world of physical objects
*** is the unconscious, non-intentional set of capacities one doesn't think about
*** is the terminus for intentional mental states
*** allows [[file:20200309182315_intent.org][intentional]] mental states to have [[file:20200309182646_meaning.org][meaning]]
*** you could move background [[file:20200309182745_belief.org][beliefs]] to a [[file:20200309182739_conscious.org][conscious]] mental state, i.e. into the network
**** but then there is some other [[file:20200224214526_unconscious.org][unconscious]] [[file:20200309182820_non_intent.org][non-intentional]] background [[file:20200309182809_capacity.org][capacity]] or way of acting
*** so the problem is the background is ambiguous
**** you may behave as if you [[file:20200309182745_belief.org][believe]] you have [[file:20200309182739_conscious.org][conscious]], [[file:20200309182315_intent.org][intentional]] belief in the physical world, but so does an electric fan
***** not because it isn't capable of thoughts but because it has no [[file:20200309182315_intent.org][intention]]
**** capacity for action is an intentional capacity
**** [[file:20200309183119_searle.org][searle's]] theory is an attempt to avoid the circularity or infinite regress that threatens all [[file:20200309183106_conceptual_role_theory.org][conceptual role theory]]
***** but it can't vindicate such a theory as a complete [[file:20200309183100_theory_of_meaning.org][theory of meaning]]

* [[file:20200329102111-causal_theory.org][Causal theories]]
** A way to break out of circle or regress of mental states
** Appeal to the causal relations the mental states bear to aspects of the physical world
*** your mental state caused by the external world
*** you have a belief that a cat on the  mat
**** not only b/c  the logical and conceptual relations that belief bears to other mental states
**** but also because there is a cat near you
** SOme believe [[file:20200329102858-conceptual_role.org][conceptual role]] plays a part alongside the causal relations
*** they distinguish between
**** [[file:20200329102830-wide_content.org][wide content]]
***** aspects of the intentional content or meaning of a mental state determined by causal relation to external world
***** theories that emphasize this are "[[file:20200329102824-externalist.org][externalist]]"
****** causal account
**** [[file:20200329102838-narrow_content.org][narrow content]]
***** aspect of [[file:20200309182315_intent.org][intentional]] content or meaning that is determined by a mental state's relations to other mental states
***** theories that emphasize this are [[file:20200329102947-internalist.org][internalist]]
****** conceptual role account
** others believe that [[file:20200329102906-causal_relations.org][causal relations]] alone account for [[file:20200329102911-intentional_content.org][intentional content]] of mental states
** Mind's [[file:20200329102906-causal_relations.org][causal interaction]] w/ physical world is a strong argument for [[file:20200329103046-materialism.org][materialism]]
*** particularly [[file:20200329103046-materialism.org][materialist]] claim that the mind must be just another part of the physical world
** tricky to explain mistakes
*** you have mental state of cat but you actually interacted with a dog and are kinda blind
*** [[file:20200329103318-asymmetric_dependence.org][asymmetric dependence]] tries to tackle this
**** [[file:20200329103313-jerry_fodor.org][Jerry Fodor]] an influential proponent
**** deals with [[file:20200329103309-parasitic_causal_connections.org][parasitic causal connections]]
***** if you have a [[file:20200309182233_mental_states.org][mental state]] caused by cats that's also caused by dogs sometimes
***** the dogs is parasitic on the cats [[file:20200309182233_mental_states.org][mental state]]
** [[file:20200329103416-cartesian_evil_spirit.org][cartesian evil spirit]] is an argument against
*** your thoughts representing cats might never have been caused by cats at all
*** BUT, you can apply [[file:20200329102838-narrow_content.org][narrow content]] as a counter-argument
**** your logical and conceptual connections about cats to other [[file:20200309182233_mental_states.org][mental states]] might be enough
**** it might make those connections genuinely about cats
**** even if they're caused by something else, such as a cartesian evil spirit
**** but, if your thoughts could be about cats regardless, how can [[file:20200329102906-causal_relations.org][causal relations]] play any role in generating [[file:20200309182646_meaning.org][meaning]]?
** open to same objection applied to [[file:20200309183106_conceptual_role_theory.org][conceptual role theory]]
*** causal theory at most accounts for why a mental state means *this* rather than *that*
*** but doesn't account for why the mental state has [[file:20200309182646_meaning.org][meaning]] at all
*** only a mind with [[file:20200329103933-intentionality.org][intentionality]] that has come into being can cause the existence of mental states with meanings related to their causes
**** so we don't have an explanation for intentionality
*** smoke doesn't actually mean fire
**** smoke doesn't mean anything
**** smoke is just a meaningless arrangement of particles
**** it's typically caused by fire, so our minds interpret it as a sign of fire
**** the meaning is in all of us, not in the smoke
** Karl Popper presented another objection to causal theory
