* how to become a better learner
** exercise
*** new neurons are born every day
**** such as in the hippocampus
***** area important for learning new things
*** new neurons will die if you don't use them
*** new experiences rescue them
*** exercise also helps new neurons survive
*** exercise better than any drug for helping memory
** practice, but only when your brain is prepared
*** sudden improvements occur in specific abilities at specific times
**** up until puberty, best time to learn lagnuage
**** stereopsis, the first two years of development
***** if you don't get this, you get permanently impaired
***** except, some doctor, susan barry, was able to fix this
***** practice can repair as well as train the brain
***** but it takes longer after the critical period
** prefontal cortext
*** learning
*** planning
*** language
*** complex analysis in social behaviors
*** decision making
Okay terry. Thatw as the weirdest fuckin talk. Kinda useless
* learning doesn't progress logically
** it doesn't just add a neat package daily to your knowledge shelf
** you can hit a wall in constructing your understanding
** "knowledge collapse"
*** occurs when your mind is restructuring your understanding
*** and buildilng a solid foundation
*** for example, a foreign language can suddenly seem incomprehensible
*** expect exasperating steps backward in your understanding
*** but it means your mind is wrestling deeply with the material
*** afterwards, your knowledge base will leap forward
* create a lively visual metaphor or analogy
** a metaphor is just realizing that one thing is similar to another
*** Jordan is shaped like a Nike Air Jordan sneaker
** as you climb to more sophisticated levels, you can toss away or modify your metaphors
** visualizing esoteric, complex, abstract topics can lead to cool stuff
*** like when early engineers starting visualizing what molecules might be doing
** they broke down, but it's ok
** can help get people out of [[file:20200309205556_einstellung.org][einstellung]]
** stories can help easily retain what you're trying to learn p
** metaphors can help glue an idea into the mind
*** because they're attaching to neural patterns that are already there
**** like tracing something on a tracing paper
* It takes a long time to learn something
** Smooth [[file:20200330185336-repetition.org][repetition]] leads to you knowing what to do from a single thought
** one chunk instead of recalling all the complex steps
** when you understand *Why* ,  you don't have to keep reexplaining how
*** you don't have to lay out 10 x 10 beans to know how to multiply
*** you simply remember that you add exponents when you multiply numbers with exponents and the same base
** YOUR mind constructing the patterns of meaning is better than just accepting what someone else has told you
** rarely learn something complex by having someone else telling it to them
** you shut down your [[file:20200309182739_conscious.org][conscious]] system and rely on your well trained [[file:20200308181852_intuition.org][intuition]]
** consciously knowing why you do what you do slows you down
* [[file:20200324144623-intelligence.org][intelligence]] matters, but not as much as you might think
** it can make it easier to learn
** but it can make it more difficult to be [[file:20200324152322-creativity.org][creative]]
*** because of [[file:20200309205556_einstellung.org][einstellung]]
*** can block you from fresh thoughts
*** a superb working memory can hold so tight to prevent new thoughts come in
** [[file:20200330185412-adhd.org][if you can't hold a lot in your mind]] in once, can't [[file:20200311211408-focus.org][focus]], have a smaller [[file:20200225194758_working_memory.org][working memory]]
*** this means you can more easily generalize your knowledge into new, more [[file:20200324152322-creativity.org][creative]] memories
*** b/c things aren't locked up so tightly, you can more easily get input from other parts of your brain
**** including sensory input
*** you may have to work harder to understand what's going on
*** but once you get something chunked, you can put it through creative paces more easily
* deliberate [[file:20200225193908_practice.org][practice]] on the toughest aspect material can uplift average brains into arena of high [[file:20200324144623-intelligence.org][intelligence]]
** can practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge your mind
*** i should do this ASAP, already 29 lol
* [[file:20200330185246-imposter_syndrome.org][imposter syndrome]]
** feelings of inadequacy
* [[file:20200330190123-myelin_sheath.org][Myelin sheath]]
** fatty insulation that helps move signals more quickly along a neuron
** evidence that they don't finish developing until 20s
*** may be why teenagers don't have good impulse control
** if you use neural circuits, it helps build the myelin sheath over them
* practice strengthens and reinforces connections in different brain regions
** you can enhance the development of neural circuits by practicing
* perseverance can be key to success for the less brilliant
** combined with the ability to quickly admit to errors
* take responsibility for your own learning
* watch out for people who criticize or undermine achievements you make
** people around you can feel threatened by your achievement
*** leading them to attack and demean
** tune these people out
** use natural contrariness to oppose prejudice from others about what you can accomplish
* Right hemisphere helps us step back and put things into perspective
** people w/ right brain damage harms people from stepping back and getting "aha"
** functions as a devil's advocate
** question the status quo
** look
* left hemisphere
** clings to status quo
** interprets the world
*** will go to great lenghts to keep interpretations unchanging
* if you whizz through a problem without checking your work
** you're not using all the parts of your brain
* [[file:20200330191456-focused_mode.org][focused mode]] is an easy time to make a mistake early on
** lead to nonsensical results
** may not notice/matter b/c your left hemisphere clung to analytical, upbeat approach that ignore errors
** if you're absolutely certain that you got a problem, it may be an overconfident perspective
** step back and re-check to allow for more interaction between hemispheres
** [[file:20200330191358-richard_feynman.org][richard feynman]] - you must not fool yourself, and you're the easiest person to fool
* teamwork
** great way to get your work double checked
** avoid blindspots
** avoids naive focused mode skipping over errors you made
** more easily catch where your thinking is gonna stray
** larger scare diffuse mode outside of your brain
** catch what you miss
** catch what you can't see
** explaining to friends builds your own understanding
** also important to career building
** avoid study sessions turning into socializing sessions
*** if they start 5-15 mins late
*** members haven't read
*** best off finding another group
* testing
** a powerful learning experience
** effort put into it is fundamentally important
** 1hr studying vs 1hr taking a test
*** retain more during the 1hr of taking a test
** very good at concentrating the mind
** make it an extension of the normal learning procedures
** checklist of test preparedness:
*** did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
*** did you work with classmates on homework problems?
*** did you attempt to outline every homework problem?
*** did you participate actively in homework group discussions?
*** did you consult with the instructor?
*** did you understand all of your homework problem solutions?
*** did you ask in class in class for explanations of homework problem solutions?
*** did you go through a study guide if it exists?
*** did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly?
*** did you go over the study guide with classmates and quiz eachother?
*** did you go to a review session?
*** did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test
** start with the hard problem first
*** difficult problems take time to solve, so you should work on them first
*** also, they take diffuse mode to solve
*** so start with hard and quickly jump to the easy ones
*** when you get a test:
**** outline over it
**** start with the hardest problem
***** pull away if you get stuck after a minute or two
***** this loads the most difficult question into the mind using focused mode
***** then loads it into diffused mode to let your subconscious mind go to work
*** think like a chef: while you wait for steak to cook, cut onions, while the soup is boiling, chop garlic
*** hard start - jump to easy technique
*** helps avoid einstellung
**** gives you a chance to look at the problem from different perspectives
*** takes self discipline to pull yourself off a problem after being stuck for a minute or two
**** i know this - hard to do this when i'm engineering something
** shift thinking from fear to excitement
*** this improves performance
** if you're panicking, momentarily turn your attention to your breathing
*** like [[file:20200330193321-meditation.org][meditation]]
*** counteracting the fight or flight response that feeds anxiety
