** Issue with the city: Now gig workers can't pee, because restaurants are pissed at them taking biz from them
** Quote:
As the City of San Francisco has
stubbornly refused to realize for 30 years, the fact that you don't have
anywhere for people to poop doesn't mean they stop pooping.

****** we need all three at the same time in order to act

      Even if you have the ability and the trigger (time window), we don't feel motivated.
      No excitement.

       Motivation is when we vicerally feel how an action is meaningful or valuable to us
       Also, we believe we can take the action
       Inability to see meaning or value means no motivation.
******* remind yourself of the why
        Remember why you wrote down a [[file:20200315133807-todo_list.org][todo]].
        Try to remember in vivid detail.
        Don't just remember the reason, feel it, get excited about it.

      Sometimes we have the motivation but the tasks seems too hard.
      [[file:20200225193201_procrastination.org][Procrastination]] though doesn't make it any easier of course, even though it feels easier than the work.
****** Turn down the difficulty dial by focusing on small steps
******* break a [[file:20200811100344-task.org][task]] down into pieces that are not too hard to complete
******** this might be hard. Identify them. List them.
******** identify the distinct parts that form the whole.
******** If it's too hard to identify parts, create a simple [[file:20200811100354-timeline.org][timeline]]
         Can be simple, bulleted.
********* start with the due date
********* go back day by day (or week by week) and write down what you'd like to have done by then
          until you get to today
********* put this [[file:20200811100354-timeline.org][timeline]] where you'll see it
********* start working on the first piece of the puzzle
***** [[file:20200811100238-trigger.org][Trigger]]
      When we feel capable and motivated, but we don't know where to start, that's missing a trigger.
      A coach is good at giving triggers - do this, then. You know exactly what to do and when.
      Reflecting, this is why I was able to start running so consistently - the therapist told me to do it, and I did it.
      Also, I did really well in the [[file:20200811100520-bootcamp.org][bootcamp]], probably for this reason.
****** We have to make the decision to start
****** We have to [[file:20200811100238-trigger.org][trigger]] ourselves into [[file:20200811100534-action.org][action]]
       If we leave the trigger to circumstance, we start right before the deadline. Deadline becomes the only trigger.

******** can be sitting down to work
********* as soon as sit down, look at [[file:20200315133807-todo_list.org][todo]] list, and take 5-15 mins to decide which task to start on
********** cue 1: sitting down to work = time to find the first task
********** cue 2: time limit ends = time to work
******* At the end of one work day, determine where you want to start on the next day and put into calendar
******* Define a specific task to do, at a specific place, at a specific moment in time

***** when you list your values, track weekly what you've done against those values
