* zombie response
** brain's default habits
** good learning is a bit by bit activity
* [[file:20200225193201_procrastination.org][procrastination]]
** avoiding [[file:20200225193201_procrastination.org][procrastination]] important because you want to learn in regular intervals
** [[file:20200311211430-willpower.org][willpower]] hard to come by
*** uses a lot of neural energy
*** shouldn't be used to fend off procrastination except when absolutely necessary
** we [[file:20200225193201_procrastination.org][procrastinate]] things we find mildly uncomfortable
*** we [[file:20200311211408-focus.org][focus]] instead on a more pleasant thing
**** thus feel happy temporarily
** but putting off studies can be more painful in the long term
** keystone bad
*** habit that influences many other parts of your life
*** so fix it, and get many more better changes
** shares features with [[file:20200311211351-addiction.org][addiction]]
*** easy to fool yourself it's better to surf the web than study
*** start to tell yourself stories
*** devise irrational excuses
*** may tell yourself that [[file:20200225193201_procrastination.org][procrastination]] is innate and unchangeable
** mastering [[file:20200311211325-habits.org][habits]] important to defeating [[file:20200225193201_procrastination.org][procrastination]], overcoming unthinking zombies - habits
** strategies for defeating are simple
** riding a bike or backing out driveway difficult at first
*** influx of information is huge
*** eventually, you get used to it, and your brain goes zombie mode, only paying attention to the necessary data
** [[file:20200311211325-habits.org][habits]] is an energy saving force
*** you don't have to think while you're performing the habit, thus saves energy
* [[file:20200311211325-habits.org][habits]]
** has several parts
*** [[file:20200315131149-habit_cue.org][the cue]]
**** trigger that launches yo uinto "zombie mode"
**** seeing the first item in todo list
**** seeing text message from friend
**** cue is helpless and harlmess, your routine you do in reaction to it is what matters
**** can be:
***** location
***** time
***** how you feel
***** reactions
*** [[file:20200315131200-habit_routine.org][the routine]]
**** the zombie mode you launch into after the cue
**** could be useful or harmful
*** the reward
**** habits develop and continue because they reward us in some way
**** [[file:20200225193201_procrastination.org][procrastination]] is an easy [[file:20200311211325-habits.org][habits]] to develop because the reward happens so quickly and easily
**** finding ways to reward good [[file:20200308141953_studying.org][study]] habits is important for escaping procrastination
**** think about why you're procrastinating
***** can you supplement the good feelings of not having to do the hard work into something else?
****** can you give a small indulgence? a mental reward for succeeding? A guiltless relaxation later
***** adding a new reward can help overcome previous cravings
****** this can cause rewiring
****** setting a reward at a certain time can spur work with a mini-deadline
*** the [[file:20200309182745_belief.org][belief]]
**** [[file:20200311211325-habits.org][habits]] have power because of your belief
**** to change your habit you have to change your underlying belief
**** you have to believe you can change your procrastionation habit
***** or you'll fall into older, easier belif
***** it can help if you settle into a community
***** likeminded friends can remind us of the values we forget in moments of weakness
* use mental tips and tricks to help yourself
* it's normal to have negative feelings when you start a study session
** it' show you handle these feelings that matter
** non-procrastinators put their negative feelings aside
*** "quit wasting time and get on with it"
** another helpful way to reframe things: Focus on Process, not Product
** [[file:20200311211325-habits.org][Process]] means focusing on the flow of time and how to manage that time
*** "i'm going to work on this assignment for 20 minutes"
*** focus on this, focus on habits
*** small chunks of time over days or even weeks
*** who cares if you grasp it all in any one session
**** point is to calmly put forth best effort for short period
*** [[file:20200225193539_pomodoro.org][pomodoro]] is a good way to do this, just focus on finishing a pomodoro
*** zombie brain likes this, because it can march mindlessly along
*** allows you to avoid judging yourself
*** when a distraction arises, you train yourself to let it flow by
**** but also set yourself up so [[file:20200315130125-distraction.org][distractions]] are minimal
***** quiet place
***** noise canceling headphones
** Product means focusing on the output itself
*** i.e. a homework assignment
*** Don't focus on this or you'll be more likely to [[file:20200225193201_procrastination.org][procrastinate]]
*** you might fool yourself about how much time it'll actually take to get that product done
- tags :: [[file:20200315130947-estimation.org][estimation]]
*** makes you focus on the pain
* harnessing [[file:20200311211325-habits.org][habits]] / zombies
** don't want to ovverriding [[file:20200311211325-habits.org][habits]] entirely
** you only need to apply effort to changing the [[file:20200315131149-habit_cue.org][cue]]
*** changing reaction to the [[file:20200315131149-habit_cue.org][cue]]
** [[file:20200225193201_procrastination.org][procrastination]] can be dangerous because it's a [[file:20200311211325-habits.org][habit]], [[file:20200224214526_unconscious.org][unconscious]], you don't even realize it's happening
*** can prevent the biggest [[file:20200315130125-distraction.org][distraction]] by disabling [[file:20200315131149-habit_cue.org][cues]] like your cell phone
**** or avoiding internet
** key to rewiring your [[file:20200315131149-habit_cue.org][cues]] is to have a plan
*** leave phone in car
*** settling in a quiet study place at proper time with internet access disabled
*** may not always perfectly but keep at it
*** don't change everything at once, just change one thing at a time
* juggling life and learning
** keep a weekly list of [[file:20200315133807-todo_list.org][tasks]]
*** then, write a list of tasks you can reasonably get done in a day
**** keep items reasonably small
**** mixing [[file:20200225194142_diffused_thinking.org][diffuse mode]] tasks can be really helpful
***** walks
***** exercise
***** cleaning
*** do this the day before
*** this enlists your sleeping [[file:20200224214526_unconscious.org][unconscious]] mind in helping the tasks done
*** task lists frees [[file:20200225194758_working_memory.org][working memory]] for [[file:20200306130402_problem_solving.org][problem solving]]
**** you'll get better at [[file:20200315130947-estimation.org][estimating]] tasks over time
**** you'll get more realistic about what you can do in a certain amount of time
**** make notes after about what you actually got done
*** plan your quitting time
**** could be earlier than you might expect
**** people who commit to healthy leisure time perform better than those who don't
** try to work on most important and most disliked task first
*** lol like i do for gym
*** "eat your frogs first in the morning"
* [[file:20200225194352_memory.org][memory]]
** we have good [[file:20200316165718-visual_memory.org][visual]] and [[file:20200316165728-spatial_memory.org][spatial memory]] systems
*** you'd remember a house layout you visited quite easily
*** good at [[file:20200225194744_long_term_memory.org][long term memory]] for [[file:20200316165718-visual_memory.org][visual]] and [[file:20200316165728-spatial_memory.org][spatial memory]] systems
*** mind is built to maintain general information about a place
*** you can tap into these to remember other things
*** we have a superior "where things are and how they look" memory system
** to tap into your superpowered [[file:20200316165718-visual_memory.org][visual memory]] system:
*** try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember
**** for newton's second law: f=ma
***** flying muel
***** f: flying m: muel
** [[file:20200316165711-right_hemisphere.org][right hemisphere]] dominance for visuospatial attention is characteristic for most people
** the more "neural hooks" you can use by invoking more senses, the better
*** use smell, hear the wind whistling past, feel the wind on your face
** to move something from [[file:20200225194758_working_memory.org][working memory]] in to [[file:20200225194744_long_term_memory.org][long term]]:
*** idea should be memorable
*** must be repeated
**** otherwise [[file:20200316165700-metabolic_vampires.org][metabolic vampires]] will suck away neural pattern related to memory before it can solidify
** [[file:20200225194841_spaced_repetition.org][repetition]] important
*** to get it into [[file:20200225194744_long_term_memory.org][long term memory]]
*** use [[file:20200225194841_spaced_repetition.org][spaced repetition]]
*** writing or saying what you're trying to remember seems to work
**** helps to deeply encode: convert into [[file:20200316165627-neural_memory_structures.org][neural memory structures]]
*** when doing [[file:20200316165634-flash_cards.org][flash cards]], interleave them
*** doing before sleep makes it so sleep can help encode them
*** use anki
*** to remember names, just try to retrieve them in a spaced repetition way
** make it memorable, make it easier to recall
** Create meaningful groups to improve [[file:20200225194352_memory.org][memory]]
*** like [[file:20200324080523-acronyms.org][acronyms]]
*** associate numbers with meaningful events
**** or with a numeral system you're running with
***** 100 meter dash, number of stitches, or what you'll feel at a given age
*** or old people from texas eat spiders - to remember the bones of the skull
** [[file:20200324080757-memory_palace_technique.org][memory palace technique]]
*** call to mind a familiar place
**** like layout of the house
*** use as a visual notepad for whatever you want to [[file:20200324152515-memorization.org][remember]]
*** try imagining walking through a place you know well, with shockingly memorable disparate things throughout
**** like for your shopping list, giant bread, giant broken eggs on the couch, etc
*** good for [[file:20200324152515-memorization.org][remembering]] lists
*** can be slow at first
**** takes time to conjure solid mental image
*** studies show 95% [[file:20200324152515-memorization.org][memorization]] rate of 40 item list
*** this makes [[file:20200324152515-memorization.org][memorization]] an exercise in creativity
*** students that use this techniques perform better than those that don't
*** using techniques like this speed up the acquisition of [[file:20200308141914_chunking.org][chunks]] and big picture templates
*** allows expanding working memory with easy access to [[file:20200225194744_long_term_memory.org][long term memory]]
*** will make you more [[file:20200324152322-creativity.org][creative]] as well
** take a bit of time to commit the most important part of a class or whatever to memory during study
*** such as with [[file:20200324080757-memory_palace_technique.org][memory palace]]
* long term memory
** HM - guy who didn't have long term memory
*** epilepsy operation took out hippocampus on both sides of his brain
**** hippocampus: horse sea monster greeks lol?
*** he was amnesic as fuuuuuck
*** In "mememnto" main character had the same thing
*** HM could learn a new motor skill but couldn't remember learning it
** hippocampus important for memorizing facts and events
** memory consolidation: getting memory into the hippocampus from working memory
*** a concussion can cause this
** memories are not fixed - can change all the time
** reconsolidation: memory chagnes every time it's recalled
*** false memory implants are possible
**** by suggesting or imagining, especially in children
*** [[file:20200225194758_working_memory.org][short term]] -> [[file:20200225194744_long_term_memory.org][long term memory]]
**** long term memory is inactive state
*** reactivation moves memory from long term inactive state to short term active state
**** then it gets reconsolidated
** spending 10 minutes each day over a month rather than an hour in one go, you'll remember thing better
** and, cramming doesn't work, it'll vanish really quick
** brains have glial cells
*** astrocyte most abundant glial cell
**** provide nutrients to neurons
**** maintain extra cellular ion balance
**** involved with repair after injury
**** may have a role in learning
***** putting human astrocytes in mouse brains made the mouse learn faster
***** einstein had shitloads of astrocytes
