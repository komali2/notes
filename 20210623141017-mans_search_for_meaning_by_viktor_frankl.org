*** on publishing anonymously
    Was initially going to do this.

**** Why?
     says goal was to "convey that life holds potential meaning... even under miserable conditions"
     Didn't want book to build up a reputation on the part of the author
       So... he wanted to objective of the book to remain pure?

***** Later says wanted it to be anonymous because intimacy
      Uncomfortable talking about "intimate details"

**** Why decided not to?
     Later, says anonymous would cause the book to "lose half its value"

**** On [[file:20200306130119_success.org][success]] achieved anyway

***** "Don't aim at success..."

***** Argues against pursuing success because then you won't achieve it
      tells his students this etc

****** Says the same of happiness
       "have to let it happen without caring about it"

*** bruh dude stayed in austria despite having an opportunity to leave
    through the visa to america
    his parents found some slab of the 10 commandments about filial piety, it was his sign from god
    think about later how he talks about the tiny snap decisions people make that alter their entire lives
      or about how the prisoners entrusted themselves to fate, so as to avoid making a decision
      i wonder if he would change that decision if he could go back in time
      would acting on the visa have saved his wife's life as well? is he thus partially responsible for her death? Well, probably not, it's entirely the fault of the nazis, but i wonder if a question like that would chew at him.

*** Wants to avoid book being "an account of facts" of the horrors of the concentration camp
    why?
    "They've been described often"
    Does he think that that's often enough? I guess it doesn't fit within his goal of the book?

**** Wants to answer the question:
     "How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?"

*** On the scientific detachment of a psychological study from within the prison:

**** "Does the man inside have enough detachment to make a methodical presentation?"
***** Outsiders do, but they're "too removed" to "make any statements of real value"
       Wonder what value means here
***** The man inside's judgment may not be objective, but he does "know"
       Know what?
***** Avoiding bias is "the real difficulty" of the book
*** Three phases of the inmate's mental reactions to camp life
    1. Period following admission
    2. When well entrenched in camp routine
    3. Following release and liberation
*** On reprieve being just around the corner
    Talks about how all the prisoners thought reprieve was just around the corner
      Like, they'd be turned away at the prison gates, or pulled out of the gas chamber line, etc.
**** Denial of reality?
     Describes first phase as characterized by "shock"
     Or, maybe similar to stages of grief: first, denial
       Were the stages of grief well defined when he wrote?
       "[[file:20210623142621-five_stages_of_grief.org][Five stages of grief]]" wikipedia
       "The model was introduced by Swiss-American psychiatrist [[file:20210623142631-elisabeth_kubler_ross.org][Elisabeth KÃ¼bler-Ross]] in her 1969 book On Death and Dying,[4] and was inspired by her work with terminally ill patients.[5]"
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief
       So, no, probably not.
***** in current circumstances, i.e. covid
      Most countries slow to jump to full lockdown
      slow to the jump
      Many people sensing that lockdown will end "soon," rather than taking aggressive action early to ensure long term comfort
        i.e. pushback on my suggestion way back in early may to immediately book a large airbnb in yilan for communal community living with a large social bubble
        my own response, both times, to lockdown of a week or two of re-adjustment, failing to immediately respond to gym likely being closed for the next few months, etc
*** Intense curiosity on the part of the prisoners
    what will happen to us next? even if morbid
    what will happen to me after being made to stand out in the cold?
*** On human capability
    Medical men "surprised" to find that humans don't actually "need" a certain amount of sleep
    Before camp, he had convictions of things he "couldn't" do, i.e.
      Sleep w/o this
      live w/o that
**** I been saying this shit for ages
     human capacity way higher than we think
     we always underestimate our ability
     but imo humans are the most adaptable complex life on earth
       we spread out across the entire planet
       we adapt to environments through external changes rather than through evolutionary ones
       i.e. we don't spend a million years evolving a new beak, we whack nuts with rocks
       or cover ourselves in animal skins
     Plus, whenever struggling, I try to think about how if dudes made it through concentration camps, humans at a baseline are capable of getting through all sorts of shit
       BUT we often don't agree with that notion, or just aren't aware of it
       Thinking of all the times someone surprised themselves with their own capabilities when forced to do something
       Like when tammy pushed the motorcycle across the crosswalk
       Or when I made it through the coding bootcamp
         On that note, it'd be swell if there was a way we could leverage that power without external motivation
           like, moms pulling kids off their toddlers
           or me getting through the bootcamp cause the alternative was debt and what i believed would be an unfulfilling life (at minimum one without much money)
           would be nice to be able to "kick that on" at will
           or just be more realistically aware of our own capabilities
**** Dostoevski: "Man can get used to anything"
     "Yes, but don't ask us how"
*** on what it took to survive, or the best dying
    It took willingness to do anything, including betraying your friends, to survive. So he says "we all know that the best of us didn't make it."
    Later he's talking about the maintenance of personal values and ethics, and whether the ministrations of the nazis forced people to become like animals, reacting in exactly the right way to survive, with no ability to be human and exert their value framework
      he decides that no, humans can't be made to become as animals, utterly reactionary to their environment
      but, his examples seem to include a lot of people who, by acting ethically or to their values, ended up dying as a result, because of the nazis
      which, sure, you can decide to stick to your values and then die, but such an argument can be and is being weaponized by conservatives/reactionaries/republicans/fascists that simp for insurance companies, or billionaires
      in america, the "choice" of participating in health insurance or not isn't actually a choice, because if you don't, you die when it comes time to get healthcare
      pointing a gun at someone's head and saying "choose x or z, but if you choose z, i shoot you" isn't a real choice at all. Can someone in such a situation be blamed for choosing x, regardless of the immorality of x?
        But, nazis used that same argument to try to weasel out of responsibility for being nazi fucks. The difference is they didn't *literally* have a gun pointed to their head. They had ample opportunity to defect, with a modicum of creativity applied.
*** Death became less scary because it spared them having to kill themselves?
    He promised not to kill himself b/c there'd be no point. His life expectancy was so short anyway.
    Are they just adapting? Accepting? What is the point of their lives now? I guess he'll answer later.
**** is this related to him saying elsewhere about how they'd leave decisions to fate where possible?
*** provisional existence
    talking about how not knowing when or whether they would ever be able to escape the concentration camp
    since they coudln't see the end of this existence, they couldn't aim at an ultimate goal in life
    so they'd cease living for the future
**** as in unemployed workers
     they can't live for the future or aim at a goal
**** time experience as a provisional being
     a small time unit like a day feels endless
     while a week passes quickly
     like lockdown!!!
*** past vs present
    most concentration camp prisoners felt that the real opportunities in life had already passed
    how depressing mang
    viktor felt there was opportunity and challenge present
    he felt the suffering was a challenge and opportunity to test his inner strength
*** using a future goal as the means to weather suffering
    he talks about this a lot throughout the book
    there's a nietzhe quote he hits all the time as well
    "He who has a why to live can bear almost any how"
*** on the meaning of life, and the question of "what is the meaning of life"
    talks about how it's a sort of ridiculous question to ask
    like "asking a chess master, 'what is the best chess move?'"
    the answer changes depending on the situation and the personality of the opponent
    he says that a better question is what does life expect from us
    he likes to frame it as life asking us what the meaning is, instead of asking life what its meaning is
    we need to demonstrate our meaning
    he uses a lot of examples of things that must be accomplished uniquely and only by a given person
    a parent raising a child, a writer writing a specific book, etc
    he call these "tasks"
    says that these tasks form "man's destiny"
    "no situation repeats itself, each situation calls for a different response"
    sometimes given situations require taking action, other times they offer opportunities for contemplation, sometimes all that's required is to "bear the cross"
    you must ask yourself "what is irreplaceable about me?"
*** on nazis
    he says basically "well there's good and there's bad people" and that that dichotomy can be found everywhere, in all groups of society
    says there's two races, "decent men" and "indecent men"
*** on being freed
    said "freedom" so much, dreamt about it so much, that it had lost all meaning
    what if this is like the hemm space stuff?
    feels literally unreal, impossible, a fantasy concept
    had lost the ability to feel pleased :(
    said that some people turned bitter, said that for all they had suffered, who dare question them?
      "no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them"
** section 2 logotherapy
*** says "finding meaning in one's life is the primary motivational force in man"
*** on conflict in life
    says that not all conflict is neurotic
    suffering not always a pathological phenomenon
      suffering might be seen as a human achievement, especially when due to existential frustration
    mental health based on tension
      "between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish"
      "between what one is and what one should be come"
      it can be healthy to challenge people on thi s
*** on automation
    surprisingly gets a wee lil communist on me
    says that the problem of boredom is increasing, and wil

   Cameron, Ian, and Thomas
*** Cameron
    Making comparisons to life is beautiful
      making something good of the camp
      finding goodness where it's otherwise impossible
    Not to sure how to take the book, what to take from it
*** Caleb
    why book club?
*** Ian
    growing problem that people need to solve - what?
*** Cameron
    Wants to know how we've experienced the book? What's our personal experience?
    Been curious about the meaning of life, figures the answer is "it's up to you"
    "Meaning" is too broad
*** Ian
    The prisoners didn't really wanna make decisions
*** General - prisoners making decisions, "leaving to fate," bad luck of prisoners being locked in house and burned
    Discussion of increasing personal entropy
    Some of those prisoners were really unlucky. How can you increase your luck? Talking about increasing "surface area," increasing "personal entropy."
    Caleb mentions giving advice to new engineers in a job hunt to prioritize getting as many resumes out as possible. Maximum opportunities for
    "something to happen"
    I mentions never really regretting going out the times I wanted to stay home, cause things are more likely to happen out than in.
*** On reading
    Cameron recommends [[file:20210703130419-how_to_read_a_book_by_mortimer_adler.org]["How to Read a Book" by Mortimer Adler]]
    Talking about what it means to read a book
      "Am I really applying what I read?"
      Is there any point?
      Cameron frustrated by how long books are, could be condensed into simple, applicable advice
      I talk about how I have similar experience with self help books

   Caleb and Cameron
*** Cameron
    Already finished the book, picked up "Endure"
      Mentioned in previous meeting
      Regarding physical human limitations in athletes
      Doesn't recommend for book club b/c not "timeless"
      I mention the AIESEC triple comfort circle
        Outer: Panic, Middle: Discomfort, Center: Comfort
        And how it is elastic
*** Resistance to book's message, and messages of "here's how to live life in general"
**** Cameron
    When reading taglines etc, was concerned it would "be preachy"
      This feeling affected his interpretation (his words)
      Felt as if Viktor Frankl was telling Cameron that Cameron is living his life wrong
    I push back, how?
      Cameron: Viktor Frankl seems to focus on the importance of community
        Cameron doesn't want to be part of communities
        Not because he's "too cool" - missed opportunity to push him on this if it's like how when I say "i'm not that cool," when really I definitely think I am fucking cool as hell and I just also happen to know that society values humble and devalues arrogance
        Rationalizes his way out of community, he's wary of it
**** Caleb
    I mention similar discomfort around community, my unwillingess to fully engage in AIESEC as an example. Rooted in some feeling of "other" to those people. Definitely some feeling of superiority, but also just general discomfort in being part of a greater whole?
    I haven't yet finished the book, so my takeaway was not that community was important, nor that he was prescriptive. It seems more to me that "having purpose" or something to look forward to was the main indicator of whether a prisoner was to survive psychologically.
    However, believe that scientifically speaking, it seems that having community/family/friends is one of the strongest correlations to having a long life.
*** On prescriptive self-help, aka "live like this"
**** Cameron
     Mentions reading "5 regrets of the dying"
       Writer interviews a ton of dying people
       Correlates common advice
       It's as you'd expect: Wish I had worked less, wish i had spent more time with family
     Cameron seems to disagree, seems to value entrepreneurial behaviors more
     Mentions Derek Sivers - Entrepreneur, writer
       "How to Live" book of philosophy, no DRM btw
       Sounds like an exploration of "what does life look like if you follow x y z value?"
       Doesn't persuade, just speculates
       Leaves reader to take that information, speculate on their own life, and make a choice of what values to follow, how to implement etc
**** Caleb
     Mentions "[[file:20210703132317-springboard_launching_your_personal_search_for_success_by_g_richard_shell.org][Springboard: Launching your Personal Search for Success]]"
       Presents several examples of people, such as a stone mason with strong family ties, a rich jetsetting entrepreneur that's divorced, a broke teacher that everyone in town knows, etc
       Helps the reader figure out from various stories, what types of success are important to the reader
       Non-prescriptive
       Helps define what success looks like to reader
     Talks about how one-size-fits-all is inherently bad
       For example, that navy seal shit that's the rage right now, "wake up at 4am" type stuff
       There's some truth that adding structure can probably help everyone
       And sure, some people might benefit from forcing themselves to wake up early
       Remembers however reading a study that found there might be genetic markers for 4 kinds of people: early risers, night owls, etc
       Some self advice might literally be arguing against people's genetic makeup
*** On defining success
**** Cameron
     Changes based on mood
**** Caleb
     Not entirely sure if I have a definition yet
     Can granular figure out whether a given day was more or less successful based on, for example, which of my daily habits I completed, how much time i spent on netflix/videogames rather than other things. Whether I controlled my diet etc. Can extrapolate that into larger week/month chunks. No matter what, though, never feel "done"
     However, know enough about myself to know that "the pursuit" itself is what is satisfying for me
     If I "learn" a thing, I don't feel good just stopping
     I didn't stop at the bootcamp, I always want to be a better and better engineer
     There's no end goal, just feeling successful with every improvement, or with the seeking of improvement
     Also know that this can be mentally unhealthy if I never acknowledge my accomplishments. Must balance the "not doneness" advantage of always improving against the disadvantage of mental unhealth. For example, I've always felt the same amount of disappointment in my body appearance. However, Looking at old pictures of me, all I can think is damn, I was skinny as hell. Unfortunately, there is no gradiation in my level of motivation to improve my body against how fat I am, they're uncorrelated. It's always the same discomfort. So not only did I not get to enjoy my "skinnier" periods, my bodily discomfort didn't prevent me from gaining weight, nor is it causing me to lose it any faster now, than in previous periods of weight loss. Bummer.
*** On reading as a time-spending activity, and how to spend time in general
**** Cameron
     Mentions the Duolingo CEO quote:
       "Our goal is to create a slightly better way of wasting your time."
       If you're on your phone anyway, studying a language, even somewhat ineffectually (as Cameron seems to imply), is better than scrolling instagram
     So Cameron likes reading, because it's at least better than other things
     Seems he also has a goal though, of building up to "high literature"
     Doesn't want to "read junk food."
     Mentions conversation with friend, exploring question "Do you have a book that changed your life?"
       Well, he certainly doesn't have a youtube video that changed his life
**** Caleb
     Feels duolingo isn't totally ineffective, but really like this train of thought
     Mentions story, dad with backscratcher:
       Was twirling this long backstracher waiting for pokemon to come on
       My dad says, "i'd rather you twirl that backscratcher for 4 hours than spend the same amount of time watching TV"
       Idea is somehow whatever's happening when twirling the stick is better than whatever's happening when watching pokemon
         I mean, speculating, it's a meditative activity combined with a minor increase in hand/eye coordination, minor increase in hand strength
     I thoroughly enjoyed the "change your life" question
       So, yes, that's a in general strong argument that books are a great way to spend your time, because it seems books are simply one of the most effective platforms/mediums at affecting you
       Want to break the question down though and really explore it:
         First, is something's ability to change your life, inherently good?
           Getting arrested changes your life, after all
         Fine, we modify the question to be "change your life for the better"
           Now, not all life changing things can happen in the space of time it takes a book, but are still things that really should happen
             For example, losing weight, getting fit
             Maybe building a relationship
             These take actions repeated over a long period of time
             Arguably, one could say "the day I decided to begin a fitness journey, I made a life-changing decision"
             Sure, but, you had to follow through, and from personal experience, that's the part that actually matters, the day to day decision to keep following through.
         Also, life-changing-ness might be a limited portion in each life
           How could you change your life for the better with every book you read? I mean, how many better life changes can possibly happen? Thinking about epoch-changing type changes. Sure, limited improvements great, but
           for example, How to Win Friends and Influence People changed my life. Later, I read "How to Not Give a Fuck" or whatever by Mark Manson. I found the latter to take much from the former, so it didn't change my life nearly as much. I believe though that if I had read Manson first, it would have changed my life nearly as much as Carnegie had, and then, later, upon reading Carnegie, it wouldn't have changed my life quite as much, because the "Big Change" along the vein of what I learned from the two books had already been wrought
     That being said, the question of how should one spend your time is a great one
       I mean why not just sit. Just sit and let time go by.
       I talk a bit about my occasional panic around how I can't stop time moving forward.
*** On aging and being in our 30s
**** Cameron
     Life is objectively getting better as he ages
     Believes he has lots of time left
     Wants to find people to whom he can say "We have decades left! What are we gonna do? There's so much we could do!"
     Talks about "unclean" motivations driving choice
       For example, doing some productive activity not out of desire to improve, or do the productive thing, but rather from a negative motivation of shame at *not* doing a productive thing
**** Caleb
     really likes "we have decades left!"
     Lately has felt like there's not nearly enough time to do in life what I wanna do
     Kinda feels bad about sort of blowing my twenties
     But in reality, a shitload can be done over the next few decades
     Thinking about some of the random goals I have now, I could probably accomplish them before dying a natural death
*** [[file:20210704115404-artificial_intelligence.org][AI]]
**** Cameron
     Looks forward to the invention of general AI
     thinks it will be the most important thing
     thinks bad AI killing us all would suck but still be kinda cool, like, as if life was like a videogame or something lol
     In response to conversation about Roko's basilisk, mentions Effective Altruism
       Sort of less grumpy, activist version of LessWrong
       https://www.effectivealtruism.org/
**** Caleb
     Talks about how nobody takes the advent of AI seriously, or at least nobody that *should* be
       Mentions always asking politicians what they're going to do when AI drives the value of human labor to essentially 0
       What will people do with their time? How will we restructure our society to allow for nobody having to work, ever?
       I mean the answer is, society as we know it will probably collapse in many ways
       Capitalism can't handle humans that don't *somehow* add value. When it's literally impossible for humans to add value, capitalism will simply not work
     We talk about how it feels like it's a fantasy, getting to AI
       Presumably, it could bring about fantasy technologies, such as nanotechnology
         Which, thus, would bring about fantasy results, such as ending disease, bringing about immortality
         We both find this feasible, even in our lifetimes
         I talk about how that's essentially my religion: a far-flung hope that maybe a singularity will happen in my lifetime
     But why does it feel impossible?
       I talk about Anathem and Hemm Space, a parallel universe's equivalent of some combination of phase space and configuration space
         Talk about how for something to exist, it must have a predictable set of circumstances leading to its existence
         For example, for a block of ice to exist in the sun in our universe, the circumstances of it arriving there need to have occured
         A block of ice in a sun is *feasible* so long as that's true. Otherwise, it can't happen
           i.e. a spaceship delivering it there with a thermal guard that melts at the right moment
         I feel like the circumstances of us arriving at AI don't feel existent
         While it's feasible to exist in our universe, the circumstances leading to it don't feel like they're happening anytime soon
     I talk about Roko's basilisk
       How everyone that can, should and must contribute to the creation of AI, to avoid eternal punishment for not bringing AI about sooner, and thus saving more lives
       https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rokos-basilisk
*** On note taking and open source
**** Brief conversation on the morality of open source vs the advantage of profit-motivated methods
     i.e. apple's arguably more secure walled garden vs the more free android ecosystem (allowing for fdroid)
     Talk about lineage OS https://lineageos.org/ apparently Cameron knows someone that works on that
*** Talking about what a book club or meeting is
**** Cameron
     very interested in the nature of getting people together. I.e. what changes when one more person joins?
**** Caleb
     thinks it's kinda cool that, for example, the book club is somehow an existent entity
     Its existence is defined by it bringing some number of people together every thursday at 8pm
     and, it has output, in the form of affecting, somehow and in some way, the minds of all attendees

    cameron finished it at some point, was surprised to find it really digging into the details of the mechanical aspects of making athletes perform better
    I figured it would try to take an abstract perspective like, ok the athletes do all this shit to push themselves to the next level, what are you willing to do

    "according to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: 1 by creating a work or doing a deed; 2 by experiencing something or encountering someone; and 3 by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering
    cameron still felt tilted from the book, as if it was telling him his life doesn't have meeting, and he needs the book to tell him how to find it
    cameron finds meaning in the moment
      i feel like that can be classified under "by experiencing something or encountering someone"
    didn't find the book "useful"
      what is "useful"?
      useful might be "good for helping find meaning?"
*** on logotherapy as one aspect of finding answers / meaning / solutions / reasons for happenstance of life
    kai mentions elephant and 4 blind men
      each blind man feels a different part of the elephant, seeing alternatively a snake, a tree trunk, etc
    freud blames all issues on stuff in the past deep in the subconcious, but perhaps he's one of the blind men
    logotherapy sees another perspective
*** on how to be - is there "a holy grail" of how to be?
    kai talks about how you go to a plumber for pipe advice, but perhaps that's not how we can deal with humans
      frankl talks about this as well, how some psychologists are treating humans as machines, taking a freudian approach, that they can tinker in the subconscious to fix issues, while frankl hopes that therapists can be "human therapists," and approach humans as humans
    kai - books alone can't teach how to be. Theres no good leadership book. Only way to learn how to lead is to lead.
    kai - we've been talking about self help since ancient times
    caleb - frankl talks about boredom vs strife, i feel like in ancient times the side of human struggle more common was strife, i.e. trying to eat, not get killed. I find that in situations where my suffering or whatever is sourced on that side of the spectrum, i easily achieve fulfillment. The tasks are uncomplicated, but strictly necessary. Such as when camping. Build shelter, make food. Yet at home, when the tasks are more complicated, i.e., do engineering, but not so necessary because i can run the credit card bill for months of food without consequences, boredom is more the thing causing me suffering, and it's harder to find fulfillment
    kai - people never hit perfect equilibrium. they're never "done", it's never really "figured out"s
    caleb - we talked a bit about that 2 times ago, how there is no "done," the enjoyment from these epistemological exercises comes from the constant improvement. Viktor talks about this as well, the conflict between who you are and who you ought to be. Between you now and you improved.

*** on the subjective nature of human experience
    kai - specifically regarding boredom. when meditating, boredom isn't really a "thing," each moment becomes interesting. Or when on acid, what would normally be quite boring moments are very interesting to the person on acid.
    caleb - wish we could have discussed more about meditation, curious how people do it. I go more the angle of not really experiencing anything at all in meditation. the purpose for me is not to make the boring interesting, it's to not feel anything at all, while also dissolving the meaning of time, as a challenge, as there's always a part of me just "waiting" for the meditation to end so I can go do "more interesting" things. So how can i "increase" the "space" between the start and end of the meditation, using subjective experience of time?
    kai - strife may also be subjective. Such as those navy seal dudes, they "embrace the suck," it doesn't seem so bad then
    caleb - well that's what frankl suggested when recommending using humor as a way to overcome some forms of strife, or just in general how they overcame hardship in the camp. But then again, he wanted to avoid using mental tricks to avoid facing the suffering of the camp. He wanted to face it head-on, to take meaning from the suffering itself, and use it as an opportunity to strengthen himself spiritually.

*** on reading books and why
    cameron - thinking about how the timing of when a book is read can matter, is curious about other people's reading strategy
    kai - many reasons.
      habitually interesting
        like some people enjoy doing hard things with their bodies, kai finds doing hard things with his mind at least once a month to be good for himself in some way
      right now is a "gold rush" of book reading opportunities, what with so many books being digitized. That's cool, should take advantage of it.
      it feels like a good idea in the same way that exercise feels like a good idea
   caleb - the first reason sounds like epistemological motivation, a big part of why i started this book club. Also, thoughts on what cameron brought up last week, on reading being simply a better way to spend time than videogames or youtube?
   kai - many different ways to read a book. Skimming vs note taking + discussing, which is expensive, not much room for many of those kinds of readings per year. A book like man's search for meaning "sails through international customs" without issue

*** on books vs audiobooks vs podcasts
    cameron - audiobooks seem not so ideal. They'll be quite long. Doesn't want to commit that kind of time.
    kai - hit that 3x speed button
    caleb - apply classic self-help advice. Break the book into smaller chunks. It's not 8 hours, it's 16 30 minute listen sessions. Combine with habit forming. If you jog every other day, simply listen to it on your jog, it's done in under a month, easily and without you needing to "think about" making time to read, as the habit is already there.
    cameron - what about taking notes?
    kai - not inline anymore, journal-style at some point, and outlines
    caleb - reflection after taking in material scientifically demonstrated to improve retention. A big part of that 'learn how to learn' class gets into that, how that's how you form your little "chunks". Also, outlines are excellent ways to retain information, it's how we did shit back in the creative writing program. And, after martial arts, we were always made to sit quietly for a couple minutes and literally just replay the entire session.
    cameron - this is his first time really taking notes on a book. It feels better for retention, or "embedding it in his life". Not sure if that's the goal. To "live with the book"

*** on "gold star" books / media
    cameron - does "man's search" really deserve this lauding? Maybe he's not getting something out of it cause it's a farce. Like citizen kane, is it really so good?
    kai - it's interesting in finding a link between the old and new. Like citizen kane isn't necessarily enjoyable but it's cool to follow the thread through that movie to newer ones, the same techniques invented with kane and modified throughout the years. Plus, those things were classics in their time.
    caleb - there was an islamic philosopher whose major contribution was translating plato for his era. People didn't really "get" plato, but he said that's cool, plato was speaking to greeks, using their metaphors and context. How could islamic peasants possibly understand? Perhaps all great works need to be "retranslated" for their era? And what plato did was still great, even if a lot of it doesn't necessarily stand the test of time. His job was arguably harder, talking about justice these days may be easier than it was talking about it with a bunch of greek peasants in an era where scarcity was still quite high.

*** on next session
    cameron and i chatted about book club strategy
    I think i'm gonna try pretty hard to get more attendees for next week, i haven't been pushing too hard, but it's time to wrap the book up
    probably do one or two more meetings on man's search, while setting up book sourcing and voting
    might want to get a better perspective on what people are seeking from the club
    and probably should apply that to individual book recommendations as well, like, why do you wanna read this book
    cameron "wants to widen the context of knowledge" and get that info "from intelligent people"

*** TODO make fun little meaningless trophies and put them in the gather town
    like cameron for attendance,
    kai for most invisible despite camera on (was his light off or what lol)
    ian for having a dog
