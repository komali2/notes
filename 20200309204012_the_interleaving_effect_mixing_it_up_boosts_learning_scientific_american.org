* studying related skills or concepts in parallel is effective way to train the brain
* blocking
** practicing one skill at a time
** common in schools, trianing programs, etc
** different from interleaving
** practice one skill before the next, i.e. AAABBBCCC
** practice and learn scales, then practice and learn chords
* interleaving
** different than blocking style of learning
** practice mixes, interleaves, practice on several related skills together
** i.e. ABCABCABC
** examples:
*** a pianist might alternate practice between scales, chords, and arpeggios
*** tennis player alternates practice between forehands, backhands, and volleys
** outperforms blocking for a variety of subjects
*** sports
*** category learning
*** math
** study by doug rohrer and robert f dedrick https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-44133-001
** practice a series of skills in a variety, rather than one at a time
