- tags :: [[file:20200224205504_learning.org][learning]], [[file:20200224205634_note_taking.org][note-taking, [[file:20200306130641_writer_s_block.org][writer's block]]]]

* Two modes of [[file:20200224210821_thinking.org][thinking]]
** [[file:20200225194129_focused_thinking.org][Focused]]
*** Seems to be associated with things you understand well
*** Works on a "well paved road"
** [[file:20200225194142_diffused_thinking.org][Diffused]]
*** Dealing with when you have no idea what the thought pattern is you need to solve a problem
*** Look at things broadly, from a big-picture perspective
*** Lets you "hone in" on a solution, i.e. get to focused mode
*** Some people that used diffused thinking
**** Salvador Dali
***** Would use [[file:20200224213734_dream.org][dream]] states to generate art
**** Thomas Edison
***** Would do similar, with ball bearings. Drop and move on.
*** Let your mind go "back and forth"
*** Kind of like lifting weights progressively.
**** Little bit of work every day.
* [[file:20200224213938_metaphor.org][metaphor]] Provides powerful means of learning
* Most heavy lifting done below the surface of our [[file:20200224214214_consciousness.org][consciousness]]
* Synapse turnover is high
* [[file:20200225193201_procrastination.org][procrastination]]
** when you about to start a task you don't wanna do, it activates[[file:20200225193505_pain.org][ pain]] centers of your brain
*** but once you start the thing, that goes away
** They recommend[[file:20200225193539_pomodoro.org][ pomodoro]] as a mechanism to get around it
*** 25 minutes of no interruption activity
*** followed by a reward
*** i'm skeptical though
* why are [[file:20200225193832_math.org][math]] and [[file:20200225193838_science.org][science]] hard?
** maybe because it's abstract?
*** emotional abstract terms don't seem as hard though but that's because we feel them
** so it's important to [[file:20200225193908_practice.org][practice]] what you're working on
** even if the concept is abstract, the neural patterns you create from practice are not
** so when learning, study and study hard, but then take a break
** this allows [[file:20200225194142_diffused_thinking.org][diffuse mode]] create a conceptual understanding
*** build a strong neural structures
* [[file:20200225194352_memory.org][memory]]
** [[file:20200225194744_long_term_memory.org][long term]]
*** storage warehouse
*** distributed over a long area
*** needs to be revisited a few times to ensure you can find information when you need it later
*** FULL of stuff
**** so requires repetition to ensure you can find stuff
** [[file:20200225194758_working_memory.org][working]]
*** pulled from [[file:20200225194744_long_term_memory.org][long term]] and what you're "thinking about"
*** what you're imediately processing in your mind
*** [[file:20200225194820_prefrontal_cortex.org][prefrontal cortex]]
*** probably can only hold 4 "chunks" memory
*** like a shitty blackboard, fuzzy, requiring repetition to keep things there
**** like you gotta close your eyes to prevent invasive memories taking spaces
*** new stuff goes here
**** to move it into long term memory, use time and practice
**** Used [[file:20200225194841_spaced_repetition.org][spaced repetition]]
***** this works way better than cramming a ton of repetition into one day
***** leaves time for "the mortar to set"
* [[file:20200225195219_sleep.org][sleep]]
** being awake creates 'toxic products"
** sleeping opens up the pathways to clear out these toxic products
** taking a test without sleep makes it harder to take that test, b/c of toxic metabolic products
** also not getting enough sleep causes all sorts of medical issues
** important part of memory and learning process
*** tidies up memories
*** erases pointless parts of memory
*** strengthens bonds of important parts
*** rehearses neural patterns
*** deactivation of prefrontal cortext lets other parts of brain talk to eachother easily
*** you can prime this [[file:20200225194142_diffused_thinking.org][diffused mode]] thinking by focusing on it before going to sleep
**** you can study before sleep, or think about how you wnt to dream about it
* interview with [[file:20200225195416_dr_terrence_sejnowski.org][dr terrence sejnowski]]
** researches neural networks and computational neural science
** elected to all 3 national academies, engineering, science, medicine
*** one of 10 scientists in the world
** when learning something new what do you do
*** "get into the thick of it"

**** Like jumping into a bio lab
***  learning by doing
** how do you pay attention to something boring
*** asking a question
*** you learn more by active engagement than passive thinking
** how do you take advantage of [[file:20200225194142_diffused_thinking.org][diffuse mode thinking]]
*** exercising or jogging
**** "unconcious thoughts bubble to the surface
**** take a notebook along with me so i can write down and remember what i was thining about
** do you [[file:20200325101855-multitasking.org][multitask]]?
*** yes, i gotta juggle all sorts of stuff
*** get my best work done doing reflective mode
*** But you can't do two things at the same time
*** "[[file:20200325101848-context_switching.org][context switching]]" is more what multi tasking is
**** this can be difficult
*** This lets me accomplish a lot
*** Used to thing All the [[file:20200325101919-neuron.org][neurons]] you have in your brain, you have had from birth
**** some die tho lol
*** But some in your [[file:20200308180048_hippocampus.org][hippocampus]], new neurons are being born through your adulthood
*** give an animal an enriched environment, the [[file:20200308180048_hippocampus.org][hippocampus]] [[file:20200325101935-neural_connections.org][neuron connection]] strength increase up to 2x
**** so find an enriching environment
***** events
**** or, exercise, as that also increases the number of neurons being born
***** like, recess helps kids learn better
*** being in a [[file:20200324152322-creativity.org][creative]] environment, with other creative people, can help
**** talking to people, explaining ideas
***** bouncing ideas off people
** tests are like any other skill that can be learned
*** don't get hung up on questions you get stuck on

** learning a language for the wrong reason isn't helpful
*** you need a motivator
*** best way is to spend time with people of that culture
* optional interview with dr robert bilder
** directs consortium for neuropsychiatric phenomics
** sometimes people think if they solve a problem that's already been solved, it doesn't count
*** solving the problem exercises your brain
*** makes unique connections
*** even if it's not created for the world or new, it's unique for you and is good

** [[file:20200306130119_success.org][to make progress]] you need some level of discomfort
** there are five factors of a [[file:20200303214411_personality.org][personality]]
** OCEAN
*** openness
**** associated with great achievement
*** conscientiousness
*** extraversion
*** agreeableness
**** correlates negatively with achievement. Disagreeability correlates with great achievement.
***** [[file:20200303214601_nonconfonformity.org][nonconformism]]
***** challenge the status quo, chalenge models
***** don't believe things just because other people said them
*** neuroticism
** When [[file:20200306130402_problem_solving.org][solving a problem]], think of the "powers of ten"
*** imagine a man in a hammock. Zoom out by ^10. It's 10 feet above. then 100, then 1000,
*** eventually you're in the cosmos
*** do the same but inside of him. cells, atoms, vaccuum space as infinite as the whole universe
*** zoom out, zoom in on th eproblem
*** get new perspective

** imagine both modes of thinking were people, and in a car. Only one can drive.
** to help get into [[file:20200225194142_diffused_thinking.org][diffused mode thinking]], do a [[file:20200306130928_mind_map.org][mind map]]
*** turn a paper sideways
**** important to help break out of traditional thinking
**** don't wanna just make an outline or whatever
*** write topic in center of page
*** begin writing anything that comes to mind
**** "vomit" onto the page
** [[file:20200306130928_mind_map.org][mind mapping]] is good for getting inspiration
** try not to [[file:20200306131455_editing.org][edit]] when you write
*** try turning off your monitor
** if you're writing and it feels terrible, just get it out anyway, don't stop
*** ignore the "nasty editing voice"
