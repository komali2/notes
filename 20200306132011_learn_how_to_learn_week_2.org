* [[file:20200308141914_chunking.org][Chunks]]
** compact packages of information that your mind can easily access
** if you were learning a song, you wouldn't just listen to the whole thing and then try to play it back
*** you might try first to learn how to smoothly play some passages
*** then gradually try to put them together
** for sports, you learn the little fundamentals and combine them
** the best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained that you don't have to think about connecting the neural pathways
** language learning: to make sentences, you've got to combine many mini chunks
** you gotta learn to chunk in math and science
*** so they give you work through examples in textbooks
**** often the solution is right there, you just gotta figure out how to put them together
**** but you have to understand *why*, not just blindly follow directions
** how to chunk

*** put your undivided [[file:20200308143941_attention.org][attention]] on the information you want to chunk
**** don't look at your messages every few minutes
**** focus
**** don't have TV going
**** you're making new neural patterns and connecting them to existing ones
***** that can't happen if some parts are unreachable because you're distracted
*** [[file:20200308143926_understanding.org][understand]] the basic idea you're trying to chunk
**** "synthesize the gist"
**** figure out the main ideas
***** let focused and diffused modes take turns in trying to understand
**** just understanding how a problem was solved doesn't constitute a chunk
***** "[[file:20200308143914_aha.org][aha]]" isn't all it takes
***** You've got to review it regularly
**** close the book and test yourself if you can solve the problem you think you understand
**** when you actually understand it is when you can solve it by yourself
**** just because you see it, understand it, doesn't mean you can do it
**** *you have to do it yourself*
*** Getting [[file:20200308143850_context_in_learning.org][context]] through [[file:20200225193908_practice.org][practice]]
**** so you can understand how and WHEN to use this chunk
**** go beyond initial problem, see more broadly
**** see when to use, and when not to use the chunk
**** top down learning is big picture
**** bottom up learning is chunking, both processes are vital
**** context is where bottom up and top down meet
**** picture walk a book, reading headings and pictures, can help you form a context map
**** learn major concepts or points first
***** then, fill in the details
***** even if you don't have everything, you can see the big picture

* [[file:20200308141942_illusion_of_competence.org][illusions of competence in learning]]
** ineffective [[file:20200308141953_studying.org][study]] methods that make you think you learning something when you're not
** [[file:20200308172054_recall.org][recall]]
*** after you've read something, look away, and try to [[file:20200308172054_recall.org][recall]] what you read
**** better than rereading a book
*** a form of testing yourself
*** the retrieval process itself enhances deep learning
**** helps us build [[file:20200308141914_chunking.org][chunks]]
*** helps make study time for focused and effective
*** re-reading only helps if you do it way later so it becomes [[file:20200225194841_spaced_repetition.org][spaced repetition]]
*** you've got to do solutions yourself to map patterns in your neurons
*** the information must persist in your memory
*** [[file:20200224205634_note_taking.org][highlighting and underlining]] must be done carefully
**** it can trick you into thinking you've placed the concept into your brian
**** one sentence or less per paragraph
**** but, [[file:20200224205634_note_taking.org][marking margins]] to synthesize concepts is very helpful
*** having the book open gives the [[file:20200308141942_illusion_of_competence.org][illusion of competence]]
*** to avoid illusion of competence, test yourself
**** test whether you really understand the material
*** mistakes help correct your thinking
*** recall when you're outside your usual place of study helps strengthen your grasp
**** this is why sometimes you suck at tests, they're taken in a different place than where you usually study
* [[file:20200308142000_overlearning.org][overlearning]]
** spinning your wheels in [[file:20200224205504_learning.org][learning]]
** studying the same thing over and over again
** can help produce automaticity
*** good for tennis, piano etc
*** good for public speaking
**** a ted talk can often practice for 70 hrs
** but repetetive overlearning in a single session can be a waste of learning time
** once you have the basic idea down, hammering away at it doesn't strengthen [[file:20200225194744_long_term_memory.org][long term memory]] connections
** focusing a single technique is limiting
*** it's like learning carpentry but only learning how to use the hammer
*** a repeat study session is good and valuable
**** can strengthen and deepen chunk learning patterns
**** but, can be too easy
**** can contribute to [[file:20200308141942_illusion_of_competence.org][illusions of competence]]
** deliberate [[file:20200225193908_practice.org][practice]] - focusing on the difficult material, can help
**** balance [[file:20200308141953_studying.org][studies]] by deliberately focusing on what's difficult
** [[file:20200309205556_einstellung.org][einstellung]] = mindset
*** initial simple thought
*** a thought you've already had
*** a pattern you've already developed
*** may prevent learning new thing
**** crowded [[file:20200225194129_focused_thinking.org][focused mode]] neural patterns that prevent you from springing to new place where solution is
*** installing a roadblock because of the way you were initially looking at something
*** initial [[file:20200308181852_intuition.org][intuition]] can hurt
*** must unlearn wrong ideas even while learning new ones
** jumping into water before learning to swim
*** i.e. doing homework before doing any of the studies
*** understanding how to obtain real solutions is important
** mastering a new subject doesn't just mean learning new [[file:20200308141914_chunking.org][chunks]]
*** it means learning how to select and use different [[file:20200308141914_chunking.org][chunks]]
*** best way to do that is practice jumping around different kinds of problems - [[file:20200308142019_interleaving.org][interleaving]]
* [[file:20200308142019_interleaving.org][interleaving]]
** method of mastering a new subject by jumping around different kinds of problems
** very important
** once you understand the basic method or gist of an idea, [[file:20200225193908_practice.org][practice]] solving different types of problems
** mix up your [[file:20200224205504_learning.org][learning]]
** look up to the more varied problem sets found at the end of chapters
** find out why some problems call for one technique while others call for another
** teach brain to both know HOW and WHEN to use a technique
** builds [[file:20200309205825_flexibility.org][flexibility]] and creativity
** begin thinking more independently
** allows you to make interesting new connections between chunks in different fields
*** can take time
** most paradigm shifts brought by young people or people in a different discipline
*** people not blocked by einstellung
*** entrenched people block new ideas

* the value of a library of chunks
** The ability to combine chunks in new an original ways resulted in many historical innovations
** Bill gates set aside extend week long reading periods
*** hold many varied ideas in mind during one time
*** helps generate innovative thinking
** gradually build the number of chunks in your brain
*** the bigger and more well practiced your chunked library is, the more easily you can solve problems
*** not all you need to develop creative flexibility
** chunks can help understand new concepts
** a chunk is a way to compress information
** [[file:20200308182105_compaction.org][compaction]]
*** building a chunk library trains brain to recognize both specific concept as well as different types and classes
**** helps you solve problems quickly
**** helps find patterns to more quickly solve problems

*** the better you get at making chunks, the bigger your chunks will become
**** neural patterns will become darker, or more solid and fully ingrained
**** a collection or library of neural patterns
**** improves your diffuse mode's ability to connect two or more chunks in new ways to solve novel problems
**** every new chunk fills in a larger portion of your knowledge puzzle
** [[file:20200308182045_transfer.org][transfer]]
*** you'll find a new chunk can be related to simlar chunks in this and different fields
*** can help you [[file:20200308143926_understanding.org][understand]] new concepts

*** lady luck favors the one who tries
*** whatever first problem goes in, the second problem will go in more easily, the third even more so
*** just focus on trying to get one problem solved
