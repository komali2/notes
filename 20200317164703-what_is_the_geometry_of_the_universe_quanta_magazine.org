* [[file:20200317164752-geometry.org][Geometry]] of the universe - fine grained local measurements of things like [[file:20200317164915-angle.org][angles]] and [[file:20200317164921-area.org][areas]]
* [[file:20200317165006-topology.org][Topology]] of the universe - how local pieces are stitched together into an overarching shape
* The universe is porbably smooth and homogeneous
** looks the same at every point and in every direction
** in geometrical terms this means [[file:20200317165149-shape.org][shape]] is either "flat" "spherical" or "hyperbolic"
* [[file:20200317165206-flat_geometry.org][Flat Geometry]]
** Probably what i learned in school
** angles of a [[file:20200317165405-triangle.org][triangle]] add up to 180 [[file:20200317165411-degrees_geometry.org][degrees]]
** [[file:20200317165350-area_geometry.org][area]] of a [[file:20200317165355-circle.org][circle]] is [[file:20200317165400-pi.org][pi]] r ^ 2
** a simple example of a flat [[file:20200317165320-three_dimensional.org][3d]] [[file:20200317165149-shape.org][shape]] is ordinary [[file:20200317165331-infinite.org][infinite]] [[file:20200317165340-space_geometry.org][space]]
*** also called [[file:20200317165307-euclidean.org][Euclidean]] space
** [[file:20200318184934-torus.org][Torus]]' are kinda technically flat too, but their [[file:20200317165006-topology.org][topology]] is way different
*** imagine walking around on one - lines loop back on themselves
*** you could see the back of your head
    what the fuck lol
**** video game [[file:20200318185049-ideas.org][idea]] - wraparound on a torus geometry
** A 3d torus isn't the only flat finite world, there are 9 others
** there are also flat infinite worlds
*** 3d analogue of an infinite cylinder
* [[file:20200321130851-spherical_geometry.org][Spherical Geometry]]
** A [[file:20200321131015-2d_sphere.org][2-dimensional sphere]] is the set of all points a fixed distance from some center point in [[file:20200321131028-3_dimensional.org][3d space]]
** A [[file:20200321131109-3_dimensional_sphere.org][3-dimensional sphere]] is set of all points a fixed distance from some center point in [[file:20200321131103-4d_space.org][4d space]]
*** Also called a [[file:20200321131109-3_dimensional_sphere.org][three-sphere]]
** for a [[file:20200321131434-2_dimensional.org][2d]] being on a [[file:20200321131015-2d_sphere.org][2d sphere]], [[file:20200321131445-light.org][light]] travels in [[file:20200321131450-great_circle.org][great circles]]
*** to you they seem like [[file:20200321131456-straight_line.org][straight lines]]
*** As your friend walks away from you, they'll shrink in size
*** until they reach the opposite pole, during which time they'll take up 100% of your visual field
** It could be that our universe is a [[file:20200321131109-3_dimensional_sphere.org][3sphere]]
*** it could be that our viewpoint isn't 100% ourselves
**** b/c the [[file:20200321131711-circumference.org][circumference]] of the [[file:20200321131716-spherical_universe.org][spherical universe]] could be bigger than the size of the [[file:20200321131723-observable_universe.org][observable universe]]
***** thus the backdrop is too far away to see
*** we could detect through purely local measurements, unlike the torus
*** spherical shapes differ from infinite euclidean space
**** in global topology
**** in fine-grained geometry
***** straight lines are great circles, so triangles are puffier than in euclidean space
****** the angles add up to more than 180 degrees
***** So cosmologists test whether the universe is curved this way, with cosmic triangles
****** for each hot/cold spot in cosmic microwave background
******* the diameter across is known
******* the distance from earth are known
******* this forms 3 sides of a triangle
******* we can measure the angle the spot subtends in the sky
******* we can then check whether the combo of side lengths and angle measure is fitting for [[file:20200317165206-flat_geometry.org][flat]], [[file:20200321130851-spherical_geometry.org][spherical]], or [[file:20200321132030-hyperbolic_geometry.org][hyperbolic geometry]]
****** These tests suggest the universe is flat or close to flat
****** One team had evidence for spherical universe
******* could have been a fluke though

** Opens outward, unlike [[file:20200321130851-spherical_geometry.org][sphere]] which curves inward
*** image floppy hats, coral reefs, saddles
** modeled basically as a infinite expanse
*** like [[file:20200317165206-flat_geometry.org][flat]] [[file:20200317165307-euclidean.org][euclidean space]]
** can't fit a [[file:20200321131434-2_dimensional.org][2d]] [[file:20200321132030-hyperbolic_geometry.org][hyperbolic]] plane inside ordinary [[file:20200317165307-euclidean.org][euclidean]] space
*** without distorting its [[file:20200317164752-geometry.org][geometry]]
*** because [[file:20200321132030-hyperbolic_geometry.org][hyperbolic geometry]] expands outward much more quickly than [[file:20200317165206-flat_geometry.org][flat geometry]] does

*** have to cross [[file:20200317165331-infinite.org][infinitely]] many [[file:20200317165405-triangle.org][triangles]] to get to the boundary of the [[file:20200317165355-circle.org][circle]]
*** [[file:20200321132717-hyperbolic_plane.org][hyperbolic plane]] stretches out to [[file:20200321132729-infinity.org][infinity]] in all directions, like [[file:20200321132722-euclidean_plane.org][euclidean plane]]

**** the further someone walks away from you in hyperbolic geometry, the more quickly they could get lost
** Quickest way between point A and point B is to take a shortcut through the center
* The reason we may think the universe is flat is our ability to observe is so small compared to the size of the [[file:20200317164748-universe.org][universe]]
** in both [[file:20200321132030-hyperbolic_geometry.org][hyperbolic]] and [[file:20200321130851-spherical_geometry.org][spherical geometry]], get small enough [[file:20200317165405-triangle.org][triangles]] and their [[file:20200317164915-angle.org][angles]] are very close to 180 degrees total
